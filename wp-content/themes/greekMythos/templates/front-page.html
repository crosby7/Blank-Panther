<h3>Zeus: Ruler of the Gods-Books Many Vacations to Earth</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Zeus is considered the ruler of the Greek gods, yet in many tales he is
  presented as a more social character. Most people in royalty do not interact
  with their subjects personally, at least that is what we hear in the tales of
  yore. Yet Zeus was considered an interesting case. By today's standards, he
  would be considered unfaithful to his wife, for many of his stories involved
  an object of romance. Hera, who was his wife, would often be depicted as a
  vengeful woman on the subject, and would many times subject Zeus's women to
  terrors beyond their imagination. That would be difficult to discuss at the
  dinner table on Thanksgiving would it not?

<h3>Zeus: Who is this Big Guy?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>
  Zeus is considered the ruler of all of the Greek gods of myth. While he may
  sound intimidating, in many old tales he is depicted as a more sociable
  character. His personality reflected the opposite of his disposition. This
  ruler is known for wielding a lightning bolt, and will hurl this terrifying
  weapon towards the Earth during thunderstorms.Â You could say he was passionate
  about his job, as well as passionate towards his many romantic interests.
  Hera, Zeus's wife and Goddess of Marriage, is shown throughout these tales of
  infadility as an angry and vengeful woman. As far as personality and
  depictions, he was intimidating yet extroverted, almost to a fault.
